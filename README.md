## Gen AI Intensive Course CapstoneÂ 2025Q1

This is the [capstone project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gen-ai-intensive-course-capstone-2025q1) for the 5-day Gen AI Intensive course hosted by Google and Kaggle. 

It is an implementation of a real estate image tagger which evolved into a Real Estate Listing Agent. The real estate image tagger would review images and extract key attributes from the image. The results would be stored into a vector database and allow text queries that are then augmented into a prompt that returns a chatbot response explaining which listings are relevant, if any at all.
